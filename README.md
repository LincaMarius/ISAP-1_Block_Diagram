# ISAP-1 Block Diagram
The ISAP-1 computer is the improved version of the SAP-1 computer made by me.

ISAP Computer stands for Improved Simple as Possible Computer

This is the first stage of the design of the ISAP-1 computer and consists of the process of optimizing the functionality of the SAP-1 computer at the block diagram level.

## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP (Simple As Possible) computer, but with minimal changes.

## Design improvement by analyzing and modifying the block diagram of the SAP-1 computer

### Original Block Diagram

The original Block Diagram of the SAP-1 computer can be found in the book "Digital Computer Electronics" by Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald A. Brown, on page 141 and is labeled Figure 10-1.

In the following figure, I present a reproduction of the original block diagram of the SAP-1 computer.

### More detailed block diagram
I studied the original schematic of the SAP-1 computer and recreated the block diagram to represent the actual functional blocks as closely as possible and I present it in the following figure.
